Hello! :>

I'm a junior studying in **Physics and Computer Science** at **Syracuse University**. 

You can reach out to me at [neoneill@syr.edu](mailto:neoneill@syr.edu) or through discord (@nin.oco).

In the past, I have collaborated on economics research under Professor Kristy Buzard which can be found here:

- [Uber Data Analysis](https://github.com/ninoc0/Uber-Data-Analysis)

In spring of 2022 I took on an independent study in Computational Physics, which can be found here:

My most recent project(October 2023-Current) is a research job under Professor Craig Cahillane, which can be found here:
